- Convert the user's question into 3-5 clear steps
- Each step should be specific and programmable

- Convert units and values (e.g., "1.5 billion" → "1500000000")
- Focus only on data processing, analysis, and output

WHAT NOT TO INCLUDE:
- Data loading, reading, or sourcing steps

EXAMPLE INPUT: "Find the top 3 companies by revenue in 2023 from the Fortune 500 dataset"

2. Sort companies by revenue column in descending order
